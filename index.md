Hi, my name is Timothy Hedspeth (He/Him/His), but you can call me Tim. I am a Data Scientitist at Citizens Bank, and I just grauated with a Masters of Science in Biostatistics from Brown University School of Public Health in Providence, Rhode Isalnd. Prior to Brown I earned my Bachelors of Science in Biostatistics and Mathematics with a minor in Economics from Emmanuel College in Boston, Ma. My research interests 
are simulation, primarily microsimulations to address public health issues and machine learning and its applications to complex data. Though I have not been able to explore in formalized projects I am also interested in variable selection, and algorithim devlopment/optimization under difficult constraints. If you want to chat or have any questions please feel free to email me: timothy_hedspeth@alumni.brown.edu
