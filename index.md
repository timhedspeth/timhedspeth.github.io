Hi, my name is Timothy Hedspeth (He/Him/His), but you can call me Tim. I just grauated with a Masters of Science in Biostatistics from Brown University School of Public Health in Providence, Rhode Isalnd. Prior to Brown I earned my Bachelors of Science in Biostatistics and Mathematics with a minor in Economics from Emmanuel College in Boston, Ma.
