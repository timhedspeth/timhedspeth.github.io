#### Project by Joanna Walsh and Timothy Hedspeth 


## What is clustering? 
Clustering is a general technique in statistical learning, where we are trying to identify clusters (subgroups) in our data. These clusters are groups that are partitions of the input data where membership in clusters are associated with similarity between the observations that are assigned to 

## What is image segmentation?


## How does clustering apply to images 

## Algorithims we can use for image segmentation. 
### K-means clustering 


### Spectral clustering 


### Fuzzy c-means clustering 
Fuzzy c-means clustering 


## How do we implement these methods? 
For this project we apply the clustering methods that are discussed above to image data for both animals and medical imaging. The [R file] is attached here for refrence in case anyone wants to follow the code to get a more speifific idea of what we do
