# Emmanuel College

### Distiniction in the field 
During the summer between my junior and senior year of undergraduate I was able to attend the [DIMACS REU](https://reu.dimacs.rutgers.edu/), at Rutgers University. Where I worked at the [Khiabanian lab](http://www.khiabanian-lab.org/pages/team.html) under the mentorship of Dr. Hossein Khiabanian as a 2020 REU fellow. After completing this project I continued this research as the subject of my distinction project with Dr. Yulia Dementieva as my Emmanuel faculty advisor. Through my senior year I worked further on this project and wrote my [senior thesis](Distiniction_Paper_draft.pdf) regarding this research.

### Statistical Programing in R (PHP 2560)

For this project we were required to create a shiny app in small groups based on a publication. Our group created an app based on the paper [A discrete epidemic model for SARS transmission and control in China](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mcm.2005.01.007). We took the model proposed by the researchers and created a generalized version where researchers can set the parameters by themself. In this project I was primarily responsible for coding the user interface and connecting it with the simulation code written by my partners. The app is avilable [here](https://nliux.shinyapps.io/PHP2560-Shiny-Final-Project/)

### Statistical Learning and Big Data Final project (PHP 2650)
This project is an extenstion of a topic that we learned in class, clustering. This project is an estentstion of clustering, where different clustering algorithims were explored regarding image segmentation.
