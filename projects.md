# Emmanuel College

#### Evolutionary Dynamic Research 
 
During my sophomore year summer/Junior year I was able to participate in a research project within the Emmanuel College department of mathematics. Dr. Allen and Dr. Sample had me and 3 other undergraduate students work with them on calculating fixation probabilities for mutants under Weak-Selection in an asexually reproducing population on a graph. In this work I was primarily responsible for working on translating graph structures of interest into complex systems of equations, documenting these in LaTeX, and solving these systems in Mathematica to derive overall fixation probabilities of interest. The work conducted in this research was published, please see [the publications tab](https://timhedspeth.github.io/publication/) which contains the abstract for the paper, and a link to PLoS. 

#### Distinction in the field 

During the summer between my junior and senior year of undergraduate I was selected to participate in the [DIMACS REU](https://reu.dimacs.rutgers.edu/), at Rutgers University. I worked at the [Khiabanian lab](http://www.khiabanian-lab.org/pages/team.html) under the mentorship of Dr. Hossein Khiabanian as a 2020 REU fellow. The goal of this project was to identify differences in phenotypes for cancer cell types from single cell sequencing data. After completing this project I continued this research as the subject of my distinction project with Dr. Yulia Dementieva as my Emmanuel faculty advisor. Through my senior year I worked further on this project and wrote my [senior thesis](Distinction_Paper_draft.pdf) regarding this research, specifically the application of probability functions to mutations in single cell sequencing data. 


# Brown University 

#### Statistical Programing in R (PHP 2560)

For this project we were required to create a shiny app in small groups based on a publication containing a mathematical model. Our group created an app based on the paper [A discrete epidemic model for SARS transmission and control in China](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mcm.2005.01.007). We took the model proposed by the researchers and created a generalized version where researchers can set the parameters by themself. In this project I was primarily responsible for coding the user interface and connecting it with the simulation code written by my partners. The app is [here if you wanna explore!](https://nliux.shinyapps.io/PHP2560-Shiny-Final-Project/)

#### Statistical Learning and Big Data Final project (PHP 2650)

This [project](php2650final.md) was meant to an extension of a topic that we learned in class, and my partner and I selected Clustering. We decided that we wanted to explore the application of clustering to image segmentation. In this work we not only present a high level summary of the mathematics behind these methods, but we also created a [shiny web](https://timhedspeth1.shinyapps.io/imagesegmentationproject/) so that readers would be able to see real time examples of image segmentation with the clustering algorithms that we present in our report.

#### Food borne Pathogen Research (PHP 2550)

As part of our Practical Data Analysis course we were tasked with a semester long project related to food borne illness using data from the NCBI pathogen data base. This project was done in conjunction with the Healthy People 2030 initiative, with the goal of reducing food borne illness. The goals of the various projects were different, ours explored the idea of using machine learning methodologies to create easily interpretable tools for public health officials to determine if a case of food borne illness is part of an outbreak. We preprocessed complex longitudinal data from the US from a 10 year period for multiple food borne pathogens, and used the years 2013 to 2018 as a training set. In the end we trained a LASSO regularized logistic regression model, which was used to create a risk score model, and classification trees to predict if a case is part of an outbreak. We then tested on the withheld data from 2019 to 2022 and found our models all had AUC over .5 and Brier Scores below .2. 


#### Thesis Research

To graduate from the ScM in Biostatistics program at Brown we are required to complete a Thesis (or project) with a faculty advisor. I was able to work under the direct advisement of Dr. Stavroula Chrysanthopoulou and had Dr. Thomas Trikalinos as my thesis reader for my work as a research assistant at Dr. Trikalinosâ€™ NCI CISNET Bladder Cancer Incubator Site. CISNET is consortium of researchers who use simulation modeling to study the effect of policy on different facets of cancer (prevention, screening, and treatment) on population level metrics. In my capacity at the Bladder Cancer Site at Brown University I conducted a systematic review of literature to find relevant simulation models for bladder cancer, with the goal of finding gaps in the current models that could be filled by the model being developed at Brown. This work is currently being turned into a publication to be sent out for journal consideration in the coming months. I also undertook the responsibility of studying Variance Reduction Techniques to improve the efficiency of simulation models, as the model being developed is a microsimulation model which is computationally expensive. I was able to research, and code examples of Antithetic Variates, Common Random numbers, Control Variates, and Latin Hypercube Sampling and their effectiveness in simpler simulations. I then was able to run sessions teaching what I learned and demonstrating these techniques to the larger research group at Brown and researchers at the other bladder cancer site (encompassing University of Minnesota, Stanford, University of Ottawa). At the end of my time at Brown I was able to create a document encompassing all I learned to pass off to another student to continue my research. 



# Internships 
For the summer of 2022 I worked as a Data Science Intern for the Adavanced Analytics division of Citizens Bank. I worked on a team to better understand the patterns of customers who were engaging with different channels.
